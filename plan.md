- Reflection: For this week, I completed the 2 practice quizzes and corrections, set up a new repository/made a seperate website for Create Task project, moved blackpink quiz with a second greek goddess quiz that was made by my partner for Create Task, Saathvika, to the new website, and filmed the Create Task video. I also added background music to the two quizzes. However, I didn't get to watch the AP daily review videos and edit the written responses for Create Task, so I will work on them next week and fix written responses as soon as possible. Although we improved the our interactive quiz project, but I feel like I can add more things to this project such as improving the design for homepage. In conclusion, I need to be more productive next week and edit the written responses. <br>

- Reflection: For this week, I completed the practice exam 3 and corrections, implemented card hover interactive feature in the homepage of Create Task project, finalized the project, redid the Create Task video, putted final code in a Google doc and saved it as pdf. I am satisfied with our final Create Task project. However, I didn't get to finish the written responses or watch the AP daily review videos and my grade for practice exam 3 is worse than last time. When I did the corrections, I got some questions wrong because I didn't fully understand the question or didn't read the questions carefully. For algorithmic problems, I should use a paper debugger to run through the code then pick the answer. <br>
