<p> Reflection: For this week, I completed the practice exam 3 and corrections, implemented card hover interactive feature in the homepage of Create Task project, finalized the project, redid the Create Task video, putted final code in a Google doc and saved it as pdf. I am satisfied with our final Create Task project. However, I didn't get to finish the written responses or watch the AP daily review videos and my grade for practice exam 3 is worse than last time. When I did the corrections, I got some questions wrong because I didn't fully understand the question or didn't read the questions carefully. For algorithmic problems, I should use a paper debugger to run through the code then pick the answer. <p>
